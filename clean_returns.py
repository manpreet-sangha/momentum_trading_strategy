# clean_returns.py
# =====================================================================
# Return-Cleaning Module
# =====================================================================
# Takes the raw TxN return matrix and the TxN live/dead indicator and
# produces a clean return matrix where every non-listed observation
# (live == 0) is set to NaN.
#
# All stocks in the dataset are real companies.  Not every company was
# listed for the full duration of the time series — some IPO'd part-way
# through, others were delisted (merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, etc.)
# before the series ends.  The live flag marks each stock's listing
# window:
#   live = 1  →  the stock was listed on an exchange that week
#   live = 0  →  the stock had not yet IPO'd or had already been delisted
#
# WHY THIS IS NEEDED:
#   The raw US_Returns.csv already contains NaN for all non-listed
#   cells in this dataset.  However, other datasets may not — a
#   non-listed cell could carry any numeric value (including 0.0,
#   which is a perfectly valid return for a listed stock but is not
#   investable for a stock that wasn't trading).
#
#   This module acts as a safety net: it uses the authoritative live
#   indicator from US_live,csv.csv to force every non-listed cell to
#   NaN, regardless of what value the returns file happens to contain:
#     - If live==0 AND the return is already NaN  -> no change
#     - If live==0 AND the return is numeric      -> forced to NaN
#       (not investable since the stock wasn't listed)
#
#   If we skipped this step and a non-listed cell had a numeric value:
#     - Momentum scores would include non-investable observations.
#     - Fama-MacBeth regressions would include non-investable
#       observations, distorting the estimated risk premium.
#     - Performance statistics would overcount the universe.
#
#   By replacing non-listed cells with NaN:
#     - NumPy's nan-aware functions (nanmean, nanstd, nanprod)
#       automatically skip them.
#     - Pandas .corr(min_periods=...) ignores NaN pairs.
#     - Our Fama-MacBeth loop explicitly checks for finite values
#       before including a stock in the cross-sectional regression.
#
#   Result: a clean, survivorship-bias-free panel of returns where
#   only genuinely listed observations participate in the analysis.
